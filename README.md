# The-Run-Game

[NOT OFFICIALLY DONE, THERE ARE STILL MANY ASPECTS I PLAN TO WORK ON. THERE ARE ONLY 2 ENEMIES THAT KEEP SPAWNING AND IT'S VERY BASIC. FEEL FREE TO TRY IT OUT, BUT I WILL GET BACK TO THIS PROJECT LATER. FEEL FREE TO REMIX IT AND MAKE IT BETTER]

You're in the wilderness, it's time for you to run and try to escape while avoiding the obstacles that you face!

It's up to you to time your jumps and get as far as you can and increase your score.

- Simple runner game made with python/pygame - one of my first games.
- There are 3 difficulties: Easy, Medium and Hard.
- Jumping on enemies kills them and you get 2 points each time. There is a very brief surface that shows '+2', feel free to make that better.


I know there isn't a highscore thing that shows you your score. I will get back to this project later and add many other things.
